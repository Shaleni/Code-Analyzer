15 Best Practices for Variable Names

codebuild.blogspot.com/2012/02/15-best-practices-of-variable-method.html

List of what will be considered bad variable naming:

 - starts with a number
 - starts with an uppercase
 - contains a symbol
 - any single character that is NOT i,j,k,n,x,y,z
 - if is a valid single character that is not int, double, float, long, short, etc (a number variable type)
 - anything over # characters
 - has a number at any location but the very last char

 General length standards:

 1 char for loop counters
 1 word for condition/loop variables
 1-2 words for methods
 2-3 words for classes
 3-4 words for globals
